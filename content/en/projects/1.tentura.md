# Tentura


---

**Tentura restores trust to crowdfunding and social media.**

Today's platforms struggle with scams, spam, and manipulation: this happens because they lack robust ways to verify credibility. Tentura solves this with **MeritRank**, a personalized reputation algorithm that filters content through your trust network. You only see posts, comments, or projects from people you directly trust—or those trusted by people you trust.

Trust in Tentura is **directional**: trusting someone doesn't mean they trust you. There are no global likes, trending lists, or popularity metrics. Visibility depends entirely on personal trust paths, making the system resistant to bots, fake accounts, and viral manipulation.

Merit is earned through consistent, meaningful actions—not bought or gamed. Tentura empowers communities to self-organize, fund projects, and govern themselves, all rooted in mutual trust.


## Core Principles

1. **Crowdfunding and social media are interconnected.** Both rely on trust, and both amplify each other when trust is verifiable.
2. **Trust is personal.** Your trust network reflects your values—not a platform's algorithm or a global popularity contest.
3. **Actions outweigh claims.** In digital spaces, reputation comes from behavior, not empty talks.
4. **Communities grow through inclusion.** Trust scales when individuals vouch for others, forming resilient networks.

## Why It Works

Tentura's design delivers practical solutions:

- **Scam and spam resistance.** Content only spreads through genuine trust chains, precluding manipulative tactics.
- **Decentralized collaboration.** Strangers can form communities without relying on moderators or centralized gatekeepers.
- **Personalized experience.** You see what your trust network values—not what's artificially "popular."

As both a platform and a protocol, Tentura supports crowdfunding, governance, and social interaction, all grounded in one principle: **trust drives visibility**. It's infrastructure for values-aligned coordination, from public goods funding to decentralized organizations.
