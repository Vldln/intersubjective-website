**Tentura is a crowdfunding platform with elements of social media and an integrated personalized reputation system.**

# Motivation

Today's public communication platforms struggle with scams, spam, and artificial hype cycles. The reason is that owners optimize the platform's algorithms for engagement, sacrificing everything else, including security and trust between users. Tentura solves this with **MeritRank**, a personalized reputation algorithm that filters incoming content through the network of your trusted friends. You only see posts, comments, messages, or projects from people you trust directly or through mutual connections - just as it works in real life, but on a grander scale.

Trust in Tentura is **directional**: trusting someone doesn't mean they trust you. There are no global likes, trending lists, or popularity metrics. Content visibility depends entirely on personal trust paths, making the system resistant to fake accounts and artificially induced hype.

The right to others' attention is earned through consistent, meaningful actions, such as helping the community identify the best projects and fund them or recommending relevant content to friends. This radical approach incites communities to self-organize and consolidate out of nothing, creating a virtuous circle of mutual trust buildup.

**Tentura restores trust to crowdfunding and social media.**

# Core Ideas

1. **Crowdfunding and social media are interconnected.** Both rely on trust, and both amplify each other when trust is verifiable.
2. **Trust is personal.** Your trust network reflects *your* values, not a global popularity contest.
3. **Actions outweigh claims.** Reputation comes from behavior, not empty talk.
4. **Communities grow through inclusion.** Trust scales when individuals vouch for others, forming resilient networks.
5. **No administration needed.** There are no groups, admins, or moderators - MeritRank makes those obsolete.

# Why It Works

Tentura's design delivers practical solutions:

- **Scam and spam resistance.** Content only spreads through chains of genuine trust, precluding manipulative tactics.
- **Decentralized collaboration.** Strangers can form communities without relying on moderators or centralized gatekeepers.
- **Personalized experience.** You see what your trust network values â€” not what's artificially "popular."

As both a platform and a protocol, Tentura supports crowdfunding, self-governance, and social interaction, all grounded in one principle: **trust drives visibility**. It is a universal infrastructure for values-aligned coordination, from public goods funding to decentralized organizations.
