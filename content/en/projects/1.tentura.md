### Tentura is a crowdfunding platform with with built-in social features and a personalized reputation system.
Most public communication platforms today are plagued by scams, spam, and artificial hype. The root cause is that their algorithms are optimized for engagement at all costs — often at the expense of user safety and trust. 
Tentura takes a different approach. Powered by MeritRank, our personalized reputation algorithm filters all incoming content through your web of trusted connections. You only see posts, comments, messages, and projects from people you trust directly or through mutual links – just as it works in the real world, but on a grander scale.

Trust in Tentura is **directional**: trusting someone doesn't mean they trust you back. There are no global likes, trending lists, or popularity scores. What you see depends entirely on your personal trust graph, making the platform resilient to fake accounts, manufactured virality and artificially induced hype. <br>

Access to others’ attention isn’t given — it’s earned. By consistently helping your network discover the best projects, fund what matters, or share relevant content, you build credibility. This model drives communities to emerge organically, consolidating around genuine trust rather than noise.

**Tentura brings trust back to crowdfunding and social media.**

# Core Ideas

1. **Crowdfunding and social media are inseparable.** Both thrive on trust — and reinforce each other when trust is verifiable.
2. **Trust is personal.** Your trust network reflects *your* values, not a global popularity contest.
3. **Actions outweigh claims.** Reputation comes from behavior, not empty talk.
4. **Communities grow through inclusion.** Trust scales when people vouch for others — creating resilient, human-centric systems.
5. **No administration needed.** There are no groups, admins, or moderators – MeritRank makes those obsolete.

# Why It Works

Tentura's design is engineered to fix what today's platforms broke:

- **Resistant to scams and spam.** Content spreads only through genuine trust paths, making manipulation nearly impossible.
- **Decentralized collaboration.** Strangers can form and grow communities without relying on moderators or centralized gatekeepers.
- **Personalized experience.** You see what your trust network values — not what algorithms push.

Tentura is both a platform and a protocol — enabling crowdfunding, governance, and social interaction, all anchored in a single rule: **trust determines visibility**. It serves as universal infrastructure for values-aligned coordination, from public goods funding to bottom-up, decentralized organizations.
