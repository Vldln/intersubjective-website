short: Crowdfunding + social media + personalized reputation platform.

Tentura is designed to solve the problem of trust in crowdfunding and social media. These depend on trust, but don't provide a reliable way to build or measure it, making them easy targets for scams, spam, and manipulation.

Tentura uses a personalized reputation algorithm called MeritRank. It works through a network of trust: users only see content (posts, comments) from people they trust, either directly or transitively. In Tentura, trust is one-way — if I trust you, that doesn't mean you trust me.

In Tentura, action is what matters, not claims. That's why we don't need moderation: everyone is moderator for everyone else. Creating fake identities gives no advantage in Tentura, thanks to MeritRank merits (pun intended ;-)

Tentura is built on a few simple ideas:

1. Crowdfunding and social media feed into each other — they should be treated as one system.
2. Trust is personal. What feels credible *to me* may not feel credible *to you*.
3. In online spaces, actions matter infinitely more than words.
4. Every community starts the same way: someone includes someone else.

MeritRank turns these ideas into code. It helps strangers form real communities by making trust the foundation from the beginning.

Tentura is both a product and an approach. It can support things like crowdfunding, collective decision-making, or reputation systems — but the core idea is always the same: **only show me people I trust**.
