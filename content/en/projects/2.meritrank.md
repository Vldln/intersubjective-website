### MeritRank: Manipulation-Proof Reputation for Web3
In a world where fake identities, bots, and AI-generated noise pollute digital spaces, trust has become the scarcest resource. Web3 desperately needs a reputation system that’s decentralized, manipulation-resistant, and permissionless. That’s what MeritRank delivers.<br>

### What Is MeritRank
MeritRank is a lightweight, chain-agnostic reputation protocol built on peer-to-peer feedback. It models how trust works in the real world: not as a global scoreboard, but as a web of personal experiences. You don’t need tokens, moderators, or admin approval — only your evolving graph of peers and their behavior.

### How It Works
MeritRank uses a personalized variant of PageRank, operating over a decentralized gossip protocol. Each participant periodically evaluates peers and shares signed assessments. These ratings form a dynamic graph that each user interprets individually, meaning your trust network is yours alone.

This makes reputation:
- resilient to sybil attacks (fake identities give no advantage),
- self-healing (abusers get isolated by design),
- and infinitely scalable (no need for global consensus).

### Why it matters
Today’s digital systems either ignore identity or rely on rigid credentials, creating fragile, gameable structures. MeritRank redefines trust for a permissionless world — where reputation flows through behavior, not credentials or tokens.

It empowers:
1. Decentralized credit and financial systems
2. Proof-of-reputation in Web3 protocols
3. Self-moderating social platforms and MMOs
4. Tokenless DAOs with credible coordination

New governance models where **trust is earned, not assumed**.

### Core Principles
1. **Reputation is personal**. Everyone has their own lens of trust — no global scoreboard needed. 
2. **Trust is earned, not bought**. Fake users and free-riders gain nothing.
3. **Peer feedback is enough**. Decentralized reputation doesn’t need tokens or KYC.
4. **Scales naturally**. Gossip-based sync makes it mobile-ready and light on infrastructure.
5. **Modular by design**. Integrates easily into blockchains, apps, wallets, or games.

MeritRank is trust for the post-algorithmic internet.
