short: Decentralized seed phrase backup and recovery utility
---

**Guardian Keyper** is a decentralized seed phrase backup and recovery utility. It uses *social key splitting*, allowing users to divide their secret and store encrypted shards with trusted friends and family. Building on Guardian Keyper, we developed **Keyper Wallet** â€” a crypto wallet with integrated *social seed recovery*.
No cloud backups, no single point of failure â€” just secure, community-powered key recovery.
