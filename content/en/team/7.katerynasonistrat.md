I am an inspired designer and researcher with a passion for digital harmony and reducing the distance between people and digital products. My interest in understanding social processes and the peculiarities of constructing intergroup interaction at one time led me to sociology.
I am now excited to be part of a project that combines innovative ideas and social responsibility and to play my part in creating a service that promotes positive social change.
