Alexander’s journey in IT began with Basic programming for ZX Spectrum in middle school. At the time, programs were loading from audiotapes. His career mostly revolved around systems integration, enterprise processes automatization, and designing fault-resilient cloud services. Lately, he got fascinated with mobile applications development with Flutter.

**Personal achievements:**
