Vadim made a long way from a solid-state physics student to a distributed systems architect. His career path included working as an independent Linux sysadmin, an IT department head, a cryptography researcher at ISDCT SB RAS (Irkutsk), a Ph.D. student in the field of GPU code optimization at ITMO University (St. Petersburg), and a distributed systems programmer/researcher at TU Delft.

**Personal achievements:**

- Refactoring and redesigning a distributed system consisting of 15 years of student code to modern standards, resulting in up to 100x performance increase (the Tribler project, TU Delft)
- Pioneering works on logic-solver-based cryptanalysis using GPUs
- Various works on code optimization methods for cryptanalysis and all kinds of data-intensive algorithms
