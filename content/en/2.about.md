#intro
Intersubjective was founded in 2022 in the Netherlands by Vadim Bulavintsev and Bulat Nasrulin as an R\&D company to apply the knowledge accumulated over their years at TU Delft Blockchain Lab.

Our mission is to forge a world in which decentralized technology fosters integrity, accountability, and genuineness in personal and business connections. We help companies build lasting Web3 products by enhancing their communities with digitalized trust technology. We call it TrustTech.
